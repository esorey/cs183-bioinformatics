My submission format is super weird, so here's a quick guide to where everything
is. I used python3 for all of this code.

Question 1:
p1.jpg is the entirety of my answer.

Question 2: Run hw2p2.py to see the assembled genome (python3 hw2p2.py at
the terminal).

Question 3:
There are 13 isoforms. The images in p3.pdf show them.

Question 4:
The various files beginning with p4 show the dynamic programming tables and the
resulting alignments.

Question 5:
My code is in hw2p5_global.py and hw2p6_local.py. The results are in the
corresponding txt files. My comments are shown at the bottom of the python
files.

Question 6:
My response to part 1, along with the code and my comments for part 2a are in
hw2_p6_parts_1_and_2a.py. My code and comments for part 2b are in
hw2_p6_part_2b.py. Running these scripts will print my results in a format that
is hopefully easy to read.
